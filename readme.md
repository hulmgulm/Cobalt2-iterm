They work well together! You will need to install the patched powerline font as well: <https://github.com/powerline/fonts>

#### Step-by-step installation
1. Drop the `cobalt2.zsh-theme` file in to the `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/` directory.
2. Open up your ZSH preferences at `~/.zshrc` and change the theme variable to `ZSH_THEME=cobalt2`.
3. Refresh ZSH by typing `source ~/.zshrc` on the command line.
